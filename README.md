# ICPC Tester

A little script to test ICPC's challenges.

Usage:

1. `chmod +x tester.sh`
2. Move the tester script and your executable to the directory containing the .in/.ans files.
3. `./script executablename`

Note the tester does not handle cases where multiple answers are accepted, or if there are differences in decimal point accuracy, etc.
